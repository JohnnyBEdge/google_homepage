This is my first Odin Project. I am to use the skills I have learned so far (HTML, CSS, web tools) to recreate the google homepage. I am advised to know the following skills:

1. Two ways to move a div around on the page
2. Stick a div onto the bottom or top of the page
3. Identify the background color of an existing webpage
4. Grab the URL for an image from an existing webpage
5. Center an element horizontally
6. Identify three ways you can include your CSS styles in a page
7. Understand how to use classes and ids to target CSS at specific elements on the page
8. Build a very basic form (even if it doesn't "go" anywhere)

Going through the list, I feel I am ready to start the project. 

It is 9:22pm on 9/6. I will see how long this takes me and update the README when I have completed the task.

well its 9:43pm on 9/11 and I have finished. I wouldve finished a few days ago but had problems getting the navbar to align. First the top nav wouldnt align horizontally. I re-wrote the code several time, even copying the answer from others and couldnt get it. That finally made me realize it had to be something outside the css or html for the nav. I started removing pieces of code one by one to see if anything changed and i finally found it in the image code. Something about having the width defined in the html was causing errors for me. I fixed that then fairly quickly finished the bottom nav. Im going to try the harder version of this to dial down some code then move on if that goes alright.
