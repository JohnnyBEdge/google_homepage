This is my first Odin Project. I am to use the skills I have learned so far (HTML, CSS, web tools) to recreate the google homepage. I am advised to know the following skills:

1. Two ways to move a div around on the page
2. Stick a div onto the bottom or top of the page
3. Identify the background color of an existing webpage
4. Grab the URL for an image from an existing webpage
5. Center an element horizontally
6. Identify three ways you can include your CSS styles in a page
7. Understand how to use classes and ids to target CSS at specific elements on the page
8. Build a very basic form (even if it doesn't "go" anywhere)

Going through the list, I feel I am ready to start the project. 

It is 9:22pm on 9/6. I will see how long this takes me and update the README when I have completed the task.
